# Uber-Data-Analysis

***Overview:***
Conducted an in-depth analysis of the Uber Dataset using R, focusing on data preprocessing, exploration, and visualization to derive actionable insights.

***Key Steps:***

**Data Preprocessing:** Loaded dataset from CSV, handled missing/inconsistent data, converted date/time columns, removed duplicates, and standardized location names.
**Data Exploration:** Summarized trip distances using the "MILES" column.
**Data Visualization:** Created boxplots and histograms of trip distances, bar plots for trip purposes, and top 10 start/stop locations by frequency. Visualized average miles by category and purpose.

***Skills Used:*** R, Data Preprocessing, Data Manipulation, Data Visualization, ggplot2, dplyr

***Conclusion:***
This project provides valuable insights into trip patterns and user behaviour within the Uber platform, supporting decision-making and optimization efforts.
