# Uber-Data-Analysis-Alfido-Tech-Internship-Task-2

  This project involves exploration of the Uber Dataset using R and various data manipulation and visualization packages. The initial focus is on data preprocessing, where the dataset is loaded from a CSV file, and measures are taken to handle missing and inconsistent data. This includes replacing empty strings with NA values, converting date and time columns to datetime objects, removing duplicates, and standardizing location names.

  After data preprocessing, the project proceeds to understand the dataset's structure and dimensions, offering a summary of the "MILES" column to provide an overview of trip distances. The heart of the project lies in data visualization, with a series of compelling visualizations. These visualizations include a boxplot and histogram of trip distances, a bar plot displaying the count of Uber trips by purpose, and bar plots showing the top 10 start and stop locations by frequency.

  Furthermore, the project features bar plots to visualize the average miles by category and purpose, allowing for an in-depth exploration of how trip distances vary based on different categories and purposes. This approach to data analysis and visualization provides valuable insights into the Uber Dataset, making it an essential resource for decision-making, optimization, and understanding user behavior within the Uber platform.
